An immense volume of speculative business was transacted with wide fluctuations far above the average the public interest in the market increasing to an unprecedented extent. The crop season of 1907 was unfavorable almost from the beginning. The seeding was late the weather remained unseasonably cold a good part of the time and at the critical period when the crop needed the best of weather it became unfavorable being too hot in many sections and too cold in others so the oats did not fill. The indicated oat crop in June was 945000.000 bushels the official preliminary estimate in October was sensational 741521.000 bushels and the official final figures given out December 20ih made the yield 754443.000 bushels. In quality the oats crop was the poorest in recent years and the percentage of standard or contract oats was probably the lightest known the weight of the arrivals hardly averaged 28 lbs. to the measured bushel. This made the supply of contract oats decidedly small throughout lite fall and winter and the advance in prices was so sharp that oats sold by country shippers against holdings in the interior had to be bought in as they were not good enough to grade here. The feeding quality was exceedingly poor and all things considered the oats trade has been the most peculiar ever known.

They have accordingly procured or taken options on a site near the town of Oroya the junction point of the Cerro de Pasco Railway Company and the Central Railway of Peru a site of some 2000 ft. lower altitude than that of the present Smelter and much nearer to the Corporations Morococha Mines and to Callao the port from which its bullion is shipped and at which its construction material and supplies are received. They are also having prepared designs and estimates for a Smelter Plant on the most modern and approved lines. When these designs and estimates are finally submitted to and passed upon by the Corporations experts the Directors ***will then definitely decide whether to erect a new Plant or to remodel and enlarge the present one. Factors which ***will largely control in arriving at such decision ***will be the costs of structural material and of transportation.\n",

      "Sales in each quarter of 1963 were at a new high for that quarter. Agricultural products accounted for some of the more substantial increases with continued growth in sales of Stam a rice herbicide Dithane fungicides and Kelthane miticides. Commercial applications on a number of crops were developed for Tok a recently introduced herbicide. Substantial sales gains were made by acrylic and methacrylic monomers. Sales of Plexiglas molding powder reached a new high as a result of expanded use in lighting and automotive applications. Significant sales gains were also made by our acrylic resins for use in industrial and house paints automotive finishes and textile applications. Good progress was achieved in sales of Primal imprÃ©gnants for improving the uniformity and quality of leather. The volume of plastici/ers used mainly with vinyl polymers increased despite severe competition. With the completion of our adipic acid plant at Louisville Kentucky in 1 963 more emphasis was placed on the sale of plasticizers based on adipic acid. Acryloid modifiers for rigid vinyl products continued to gain in sales volume. A number of products introduced in 1962 contributed to the improvement in 1963 sales and are ***expected to show additional yearly increases. These include a number of new methacrylate monomers used by our customers in polymer production and an acrylic emulsion used as an adhesive for attaching polyurethane foam to apparel fabrics. Sales resulting from the acquisition during 1963 of Sauquoit Silk Company Inc. and The WarrenTeed Products Company are also reflected in the higher total for the year.\n",

      "                 TO THE STOCKHOLDERS                  In the decade of the sixties your company grew seventy per cent in sales thirty six per cent in earnings per share and one hundred eight per cent in book value. As we enter the seventies we feel well prepared to meet the new challenges of the new decade and ***predict an accelerated rate of growth and diversification. Significantly we have four new members on the Board of Directors. In July of 1969 C. B. Lane who is Vice President and Treasurer of the company was elected to the Board of Directors and since that time he has been made Chairman of the Executive Committee. In January of 1970 for the first time in over twelve years out side Directors have been added to the Board. They are Trammell Crow with wide experience in real estate investments Vester T. Hughes Jr. of the Dallas law firm of Jackson Walker Winstead Cantwell  Miller and Robert H. Stewart III Chairman of the Board of Directors of the First National Bank in Dallas. Each of the four new Directors brings a new enthusiasm and a new viewpoint to the Board. To finance our planned program of growth diversification and acquisition we have an enviable choice of options. We have a large reservoir of untapped credit due to our liquidity our limited debt and the ownership of well maintained properties in good locations acquired when prices were much lower. We also have by virtue of our 1969 Charter amendments unissued shares of common stock as well as unissued series preferred shares which ***could be used for acquisitions. We have a sound and broad base in the wholesale baking business where year after year we have carried through to profit a higher percentage to sales than other baking companies. Our plans contemplate a steady growth in our traditional business. Our Merico Inc. division is structured to expand in diversified food lines. We have made a notable record in the refrigerated dough business. Our toaster items which were introduced in early 1969 have already required an increase in production facilities. Our \"MixMeNot\" cake is one of the genuinely new food products of recent years. We acquired four soft drink plants in 1969 thus giving an entry into a rapidly growing field. At the same time a canning operation was acquired the growth ***potential of which we are still studying. We believe that our historical concept of decentralized autonomous operations has made a great contribution to the depth of management that is one of the great assets of the company. In summary we feel that we have all of the ingredients to insure success in the years to come. While our principal concentration is upon the ***future we do want to look back briefly at 1969. Our sales were 294.6 million the highest in our history and 5 above sales in 1968. Profits per share were 3.45 a reduction from 1968s 3.70. To some extent we suffered with other companies which found that rising costs ***could not be covered by price adjustments. However in the knowledge that one must spend money to make money we incurred and charged to expense development and startup costs on new products which reduced our profit by 16 cents a share. We ***expect this to be returned many fold in ***future years.\n",

      "Shortly after the turn of the century Willis Haviland Carrier then a young engineer who had been graduated only the year before from Cornell University was given an assignment. Out of its successful completion an industry was born. The problem posed by his employer Buffalo Forge Company was to control both temperature and humidity in a Brooklyn lithographing plant. No one before him had ever succeeded in harnessing these two together. But young Carrier did it. And he also provided air cleaning and control of air motion  thereby satisfying the four most basic requirements of modern day air conditioning. It is significant that this combination of art and science was born in working dress and spent its early days in these same clothes. It went into textiles into tobacco into the making of celluloid film for the early \"flickers\" into pharniaceuticals even into a blast furnace  always providing a better atmosphere for production  before it was ever applied widely to the promotion of human comfort health and efficiency. The infant industry grew slowly. Much had to be learned. Machines had to be invented. And Dr Carrier and his colleagues were ever the pioneers. He alone filed eightyfour patents. Three companies bore his name  Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America formed in 1908 as a subsidiary of Buffalo Forge Carrier Engineering Corporation founded in 1915 by seven courageous young men who scraped together 35000 and branched out on their own and the present Corporation established in 1930. Much has been accomplished in the fifty years since the date of July 17 1902 was written in at the bottom of the first completed drawing of the original installation. But only in the last decade has the industry fathered by Willis Haviland Carrier entered its period of real growth.

To what extent the management of the Company were able to adjust operating costs to suit conditions of restricted demand and extreme competition imposed by tariff reductions and other influences without reducing labor rates it ***may be stated that the principal products manufactured by the Company were reduced in cost during the past six months as compared with the costs of the preceding six months period by approximately S per cent. the selling prices of the principal products were reduced approximately 20 per cent. the contraction in volume of business measured by the Companys capacity about 33 per cent. a.nd the shrinkage in Unfilled Orders of Finished and Semifinished Products as compared with June 30 1913 over 30 per cent. The Net Earnings of the Company for the six months period ending June 30 1914 under the conditions stated necessarily declined being Â§1321831.12. After all provisional charges and deduction.Â« the net balance applicable to dividends was SGlS. 775.71 this amount fell short of dividend requirements by 250224.29 which amount was appropriated from previously accumulated profits and applied to dividend account leaving a net balance to surplus as of June 30 1914 of SG256553.35 and a balance to Xet Working Assets of the Company as of June 30 1914 of Â§10491968.46.

The ***future ***outlook for an increased volume of business is favorable.

Household has no connection with merchandisers whereby installment sales contracts are financed. Customers voluntarily apply to a Household office for money because of their own necessity. The money which Household lends to its customers is usually used for the purpose of meeting a sudden financial emergency or to repay previously incurred debts which have become embarrassing and which can only be liquidated over a longer period of time. It is estimated that 80 of the families in the United States are not in a position to obtain credit from banking institutions. Though large in number these people are weak economically. When faced with a financial emergency their necessity deprives them of equality of bargaining power with the lender. In the past and even now in states where the provisions of the law are inadequate such borrowers have been subject to oppressive and illcg.il interest exactions or have been handicapped by inability to obtain needed funds. Rates ranging from 5 to 20 per month were the rule and higher rates not uncommon\n",

      "GENERAL RAILWAYIGNAL foMPAsrg. Rochester N. Y. January 23 1930. To the Stockholders of the General Railway Signal Company By authority of your Board of Directors your Officers submit herewith statements of the financial condition and income accounts of your Company for the fiscal year ended December 31st 1929. The dollar value of unfilled orders on hand January 1 1929 was 23.5 greater than at the same period in 1928. Volume of orders booked in 1929. was almost equally divided between the first and second half of the year and was 57 greater than in 1928. Value of orders executed in 1929 was 31 greater than in 1928. Volume of unfilled orders on hand January 1 1930 is 99 greater than on January 1 1929. Prospects for booking new business in 1930 are good. In 1929 orders were received from 20 railways for 39 interlocking machines having a total of 2245 levers from 20 railways for 9535 electric signals for car retarder equipment of the Classification Yards of. the New York New Haven  Hartford at Providence the Michigan Central at West Detroit and the New York Central at Buffalo Gardenville. Orders were also received from 9 railways for the equipment of 249 locomotives with automatic train control devices and from 14 railways for 14 major and 16 minor installations of your recently developed Centralized Traffic Control System under which a single train director ***may operate all switches and signals and control all train movements over many miles of line. Owing to its now widely recognized advantages in greatly facilitating train movement and lessening operating costs the employment of this system is rapidly Increasing. Value of repair and renewal orders for 1929 was 50 greater than In 1928 thus maintaining the trend of several years past. In 1929 after all charges including liberal reserves for depreciation amortization and taxes and after payment of dividends on preferred stock the residue of net earnings available for common stock dividends was as follows First quarter 0.76 second quarter 1.93 third quarter 2.84 fourth quarter 2.72 making a total of 8.25. At the time of the recent securities market crash your Board of Directors after careful consideration decided that the interests of the Companys Stockholders would be served by having the Company purchase its own stocks at low prices then prevailing. Accordingly it bought 20550 shares of the Common Stock at an average cost of 80.29 and 4691 shares of the Preferred Stock at an average cost of 100. Your Companys organization plant and equipment are in excellent condition. The accompanying statements clearly Indicate its financial condition. Respectfully submitted W. W. SALMON President. G. D.

      "To THE STOCKHOLDERS I introducing last years report J directed attention to the fact that prevalent social demands added to military defense and foreign aid expenditures place an incalculably great burden upon the economy of our nation and that a longrun inflationarv tendency would inevitahlv follow unless there were a corresponding growtli of wealth. Consequently I urged that public policies be pursued which would stimulate rallier than discourage individual endeavor within our societv. The vear that has gone bv carried our economv further along the dangerous road we are travelling. The \"cold war continues foreign expenditures are more than ever indispensable while social demands grow at an increasing pace. The consequence is that even at the prevalent high level of both national income and taxation the Federal budget is out of balance. Indeed it is quite possible now that the budget ***will remain unbalanced as long as the \"cold war\" drais on. Meanwhile the hiih level of taxation reduces the volume O v of individual savings interferes thereby with the creation of newcapital available for business expansion and economic growth reduces the vitality of our free enterprise economy and ***eventually leads to a reduction of the tax receipts of the government  a vicious circle. If this unhealthv drift is not arrested the ***future of our institutions ***will be increasingly compromised. A method must be found to satisfy the prevalent craving for individual security in ways which do not stifle our economic system bv adding greatlv to our Federal expenditures at the time of the heavy \"cold war\" requirements. At the present time roughly onethird of the budget consists of direct and indirect subsidies which are paid by the Federal government i.e. the body of taxpayers to special groups and some of them very large groups of American citizens. This interferes with the flexibility of our economy reduces individual thrift and selfreliance and to a considerable extent dampens the spirit of enterprise which has made the American economv so fertile in ideas and so productive in goods. Unless we are able at least to reduce Federal expenditures on subsidies paid to special organi/ed groups of our fellow citizens  unless we adopt positive policies to make our eeonomv adaptable resourceful and dynamic  unless we reduce the level and modify the structure of taxation so as to encourage individual thrift and creation of capital therein\" leading to a healthy growth of national income thus breaking the abovementioned vicious circle we ***shall find that our free institutions rest upon increasingly weak foundations. There is still time to strengthen these foundations but we must stop drifting. We are faced with a very real challenge not only to political parties but Io each and everv thoughtful citizen of our country.\n",

      "3CANNUAL STATfMtNT LINCOLN NATIONAL INSURANCE COMPANY wAYN?? INDIANA To Lincoln Life Policy Owners Improvement in the combined production of new business of all the life insurance companies was shown in 1934 for the first time in five years. Even though production in 1934 increased 10 over 1933 yet the total insurance in force in all companies was less at the end of 1934 than at the end of 1929. During the depression period liquidation of policies chiefly due to loans upon them took place similarly to liquidation in all other lines lapses and maturities of policies together with death claims exceeded in amount the new insurance written. This tendency seems now to have been overcome and it is generally believed that total insurance in force of the companies as a whole ***will increase from year to year. The great confidence placed in life insurance companies has been fully justified. No other institution has approached the record made by life insurance during the depression. During the last five years the companies as a whole have paid to policy owners and their beneficiaries over 15 billion dollars  more than half of it to living policy owners. Also during the same period over 4 billion dollars has been added to the credit of policy owners to be paid to them in ***future years.\n",
